    ACTION TAKEN: None. The business logic of this conditional statment sets a variable to 0. In 
                  circumstance of variable equality, the `multiplier` is set to zero (The 
                  refundSchedule's last index, this is inforced by the refundSchedule setter
                  function's requirments).

    ACTION TAKEN: None. The business logic of this conditional statment sets a variable to 0. In 
                  circumstance of variable equality, it is later set to zero as well (the two values
                  are subtracted. The if statment is to protect against creating a nagitive number).
