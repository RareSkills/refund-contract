    Original line:
                 require(_startTime >= maxPastTime && _startTime <= maxFutureTime,

                 require(_startTime >= maxPastTime && _startTime < maxFutureTime,

    ACTION TAKEN: None. This require statment is to enforce a range. Changing the 
                  `<=` to a `<` ensures the value is still within the range. The 
                  possible change here would be to use the more restrictive operator
                  and variable -> `maxFutureTimePlusOneSecond` but this has been
                  avoided for simplicity.

    ACTION TAKEN: None. The business logic of this conditional statment sets a variable to 0. In 
                  circumstance of variable equality, the `multiplier` is set to zero (The 
                  refundSchedule's last index, this is inforced by the refundSchedule setter
                  function's requirments).

    Original line:

    Mutated line:
                 if (currentTime <= startTime) { 

    ACTION TAKEN: None. The business logic of this conditional statment sets a variable to 0. In 
                  circumstance of variable equality, it is later set to zero as well (the two values
                  are subtracted. The if statment is to protect against creating a nagitive number).

[*] Done!
